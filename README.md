# StopwatchWin32

by Giovanni Dicanio

A simple C++ Stopwatch class implemented using Windows Win32 native C APIs
(high-resolution time stamps: `QueryPerformanceCounter` and `QueryPerformanceFrequency`).

This is a _header-only_ class implemented in the [Stopwatch.h](https://github.com/GiovanniDicanio/StopwatchWin32/blob/master/Stopwatch/Stopwatch.h) file.

To reuse it in your projects, just `#include "Stopwatch.h"`.
